it is simple.

have discipline.

do what you said you would do.

be honest with yourself so that you can be honest with others.

keep you ego in check. are you big enough to aim low enough?

know when you have taken on too much.

accept defeat in the battle so you can win the war.

do not waste time. the only currency which you cannot retrieve back.

it is a privilege to live your life.

it is a privilege of the living, to die. 

it is a privilege to leave this world knowing you have lived a life without betrayal towards self.

most of all, have the intelligence to realize that all this take great patience and grace.
