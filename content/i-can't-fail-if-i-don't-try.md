**i can't fail if i don't try**

wrong!

failure gets a bad rep.  
what does it mean to fail?  
is it to not achieve what one has set out to achieve?  
but why do we need to define it that way?

i refuse to label failure that way.

new definition: **failure is not trying**

_failure is the privilege of those who tried._

as long as i have tried and given it whatever i can give to progress towards my goal, i simply have not failed.

the project that never materialized? not a failure.  
i learned the process of shaping a thought.

the diet that never stuck? not a failure.  
i learned what it takes and what i need to do to stick to it.

the meditation habit that was never kept? not a failure.  
i learned the consequences of not sticking to it.  
that one hurt. but pain is data too.

every attempt teaches. every non-attempt doesn't.

so what are you not trying?  
and more importantly, why are you calling that "safe"?
