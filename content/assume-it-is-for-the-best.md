here is a concept: **assume everything is happening for the best**

got the outcome you wanted?  
great, it was for the best  
didn't get it?  
also for the best.

you can't know anything with absolute certainty. how can you be sure something that happened was actually bad for you? 

maybe it saved you from something worse. maybe it redirected you toward something better. you'll never know until the end.

so I choose to believe that whatever happens, happens for the best. for reasons beyond what I can see or understand right now.

at the end of the day, we all choose what to believe. those beliefs shape how we experience life.

might as well choose one that helps you move forward.
