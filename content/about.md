*there's a bluebird in my heart that*  
*wants to get out*  
*but I'm too tough for him,*  
*I say,*  
*stay down, do you want to mess*  
*me up?*  
*you want to screw up the*  
*works?*  
*you want to blow my book sales in*  
*Europe?*  
*there's a bluebird in my heart that*  
*wants to get out*  
*but I'm too clever, I only let him out*  
*at night sometimes*  
*when everybody's asleep.*  
*I say, I know that you're there,*  
*so don't be*  
*sad.*  
*then I put him back,*  
*but he's singing a little*  
*in there, I haven't quite let him*  
*die*  
*and we sleep together like*  
*that*  
*with our*  
*secret pact*  
*and it's nice enough to*  
*make a man*  
*weep, but I don't*  
*weep, do*  
*you?*  

— Charles Bukowski
