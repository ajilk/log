what if nothing is broken?

what if the work is accepting there is no work to do?

here is a meditation: **nothing is wrong**

everything is perfect as it is right now

the ideal state is not somewhere in the future

it is here, right here, right now

the future does not exist

the future is not a place of perfection where worry, uncertainty, and hardships don't exist

this is it

accept it fully, embody it

this is the work

it is not a means to an end

it is the end itself

do it

don't question it

don't hope things *were* different

don't hope things *will* be different

accept what is, fully

and change will naturally come

but do not hope for it

let it be the result of your **unwavering commitment** to the present moment

**the only place where life exists**
